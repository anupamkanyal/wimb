				<p>Because of traffic variations, breakdowns, and day-to-day problems faced by transit providers, passenger's daily travel can get interrupted any time; WhereIsMyBus is a system designed to keep passengers on schedule even if their bus isn't. It is easy for passenger to stay on schedule, plan their travel, and never miss a bus again.</p>
				<p>Passengers can get the bus information whenever and wherever on a PC or a GPRS enabled mobile phone. They can search for buses, and track their position in real-time in a map</p>
				<p><b>Click StartTracking! now and choose your bus to track.</b></p>

                                <p>WhereIsMyBus uses a combination of GPS-Tracking, GPRS and map rendering technologies to enable public transit citizens to track the position of buses to accuracies of 10s to 100s of meters. All the buses are provided with a smartphone app (held by the bus conductor) which autonomously transmits GPS coordinates at regular intervals to our servers which in turn stores the coordinates in a centralized database and render it into maps as requested by the user.</p>
